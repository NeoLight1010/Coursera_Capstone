    "Tourism is an important economic income for cities. Some cities are attractive because of their beaches, their building, their history and much more. But there are also some cities which wouldn't be nice to go for a vacation. In this project I will train in a machine learning model that can determine how attractive a given city would be for tourists based on other attractive cities."
