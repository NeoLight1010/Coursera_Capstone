# Coursera Capstone Project  
Anthony Sua≈ïez  

This project is my submission for the Coursera Data Science Specialization Course.  
I hope you like it!  

## Repository description

During week 3 I used Foursquare and Wikipedia data to cluster neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada. The notebooks from that week are in the `week3` folder.

During weeks 4 and 5 I will be working on the capstone project. The notebooks from those weeks will be in the `capstone` folder.

All of the data used in this course is in the `data` folder.
